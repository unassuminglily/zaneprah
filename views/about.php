				<p>For many years, hair just like clothing has been a major part of how a person is perceived. It is a means through which people have expressed themselves. Hair to some extent can affect the general mood of people especially black women. Hair has also played a political and historical role in the lives of black women. In the pre-colonial era, the African braids were used as a means to identify the tribes of Africans. Women and men also wore their afros as a means of fighting for equal rights in America. Many artists such as Jean Basquiat have had an impact in society through not just their artworks but their ability to express themselves through their hairs. This is why we believe that the hair is an identity. An identity which deserves to be treated like royalty. </p>
				<p>We have been blessed with the opportunity to have our hairs treated like royalty in African salons. These salons did not only treat our hair with the respect that it deserved but it also provided the safe space we needed. The family away from home that treated our hair with care, love and luxury just like royalty. Many of us were able to freely express ourselves at these salons without being ridiculed or treated as an alien. This was something I found lacking when I came to Lancaster. The salons here were created to cater for white people. Black people here had to learn to cater for their own hair. This required a lot of time and many people lack the time required to do this. Those who had time did not have the skills necessary to treat their hair with the proper care it required. </p>
				<p>This led to the formation of the brand Zaneprah hair. As a brand, not only do we treat the hair of our clients as the royalty it is, we are also a safe space for our clients. We create products   and services that aid our clients with the easy maintenance and protection of their hair whilst making our clients feel like the beautiful, powerful queens that they are. We are interested in the luxury and comfort of our clients. we have collaborated with some African creative to create long lasting products for our clients. </p>
